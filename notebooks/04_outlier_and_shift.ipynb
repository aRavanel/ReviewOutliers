Found out that the thermostat stopped working, causing my evaporator to freeze up (literally looked like an ice Popsicle). You can see this through the vent holes at the bottom of the inside of your freezer. You will see a block of ice forming on the evaporator (radiator like thing). I did not know the thermostat was the problem at first but was the cheapest thing to try first. Once I cut off the old thermostat, I spliced this new one in and used heat shrink tubing to cover the wires. After this, and letting the evaporator defrost fully, I turned the fridge back on and has been running since without further issues. This was 2 months ago. Hope this helps.",

The problem was while the plastic clips fit, and the metal clips fit and the holes lined up, the screws were too big and would not go in. I used a cordless drill to try to get them to go in, but it only stripped the threads off the screws. I ended up having to take some self tapping sheet metal screws and the cordless drill to get them in. Once I did that, everything was secure.<br /><br />Also, the feet for the dryer didn't want to go in more than a 1/8-1/4 turn. Turns out there is some sort of bump in the screw threads that you have to get past. It was a pain to install this kit overall. Physically stacking them wasn't an issue as the dryer is relatively light and I had help. There is no way I would attempt this without a second person, it'd be asking for injury.<br /><br />I wish they would have included the proper screws or at least a couple of sizes of screws.

Not only are they super affordable, but they're easy to install and the design of the filter has remained consistently the same. I don't even think it's possible to find our particular filter size in a big box store anymore, and the last time I tried I ended up returning it as it's design had been updated and no longer was a good fit - despite what the package claimed. These Waterdrop filters always look the same and are a perfect, snug fit. The water tastes great, too! I would absolutely recommend these.",

           "High quality fabricated parts/n/nI needed to reroute & replace my flexible dryer vent exhaust hose & decided to upgrade with solid metal ductwork. I checked out alternative brands readily available at home improvement stores, but the fabrication quality was awful and it was impossible to find any product that had matching extensions. I researched products and found that Lambro is a high quality manufacturer that has complete matching extensions & transitions so that all pieces are guaranteed to fit together from beginning to end.<br /><br />The entire set begins with a rectangular space-saver duct with extensions that went up through the ceiling, then transitions to 4” round exhaust duct with one round 90° elbow joint, terminating with a floating cup vent. All pieces matched perfectly & I could have secured them with the foil tape alone, but I added 2 rivets per joint for overkill. Lambro’s fabrication is impressive - no gaps or misshapen pieces like what I found in stores. I matched this with a MagVent magnetic dryer hose attachment (not shown) and it all fits seamlessly together.<br /><br />Note: Lambro doesn’t sell products off it’s website, but they list all compatible parts & model numbers that you can subsequently search for online. I found all but one part on Amazon, and all arrived promptly and in excellent condition. Everything can be assembled easily by hand and secured with foil tape. End result is that it looks much cleaner and works far better than the old flexible vent hose, which I’ll never have to replace again.<br /><br />I would definitely purchase all of these products again.",

I used it on a Kenmore fridge as it has the same part number which goes on several makes. I saved about $70.00 dollars over buying it at an appliance store locally, and about $60.00 to $70.00 if I had ordered it from Sears. Took less that 10 minutes to change and now we have an ice dispenser again. The only reason I give this company five stars is that's all there is, if they had more I would give them more.

The old switch broke a long time ago and I just jumpered the connector to bypass it. But for the money, it makes me feel better to have this back in place. It appears almost identical to the one I removed, with one exception - I think this one has an extra metal shield below the paddle part of the switch itself, perhaps to keep an out of balance tub from striking the plastic switch (which is what I think happened to my old one). So that seems like a good thing. One thing to note - this does not come with screws, and I had no idea where mine were. I have plenty of stainless steel screws, but not any countersunk ones, and that's what you really need for this. I used the smallest head I had and they just clear the lid, but I'd like a little more clearance, so I'll locate some better choices. Just something to keep in mind.",

Also it is claimed that the piece was designed with usability in mind, this filter is packaged with louder colors and an instinctive model number to practically guarantee you are getting the right filter for your fridge. Along with this comes a significant increase in contaminant reduction up from 16 to a NSF certified 66. Now, my issue comes in the fact that aside from the astronomical price, the filter (which does everything but give you a sponge bath) needs to have three gallons of water flushed through it in order to be safe and drinkable.  I don't know about you, but in order to complete this requisite requirement, one is spending an inordinate amount of time filling and dumping out 'fresh' water from the fridge dispenser.

I wish this had been around for years!<br /><br />I can tell from looking at the two that they are made with the same charcoal inside, the material that air flows through is purposefully thin on both which allows me to see that they are the same inside.  The fit is perfect, and it installed in seconds.

I say that because the burner I had originally planned to buy for my stove, to exactly replace my old one, had six turns. It doesn't seem to make a difference in the amount of heat this one puts out. I plugged it in and turned my knob to high and within seconds it was very hot. I normally order everything on Prime in order to receive products faster but this was the cheapest (and most legitimate looking) burner available on Amazon. It arrived in three days (ordered Sunday night arrived Wednesday morning). I think that's pretty good timing for a product only promised to be there within a week and a half. And at half the price of the big box stores I researched this is a good product, even if it was misrepresented as having more turns. Oh and I should mention it is not a genuine Calrod burner, but it works just fine in my late 90's GE range.<br /><br />Update 7-25-2012: Company representative just contacted me and offered very nicely to give me a refund. I insisted that I really am satisfied with the product and she asked if I would then please remove my \"negative review\". While I don't believe my review is negative, in fact, I think it's pretty fair.

           "Glad I Bought It/n/nI'm copying and pasting the review I used at Home Depot, because that is where I bought this compactor. However, I spent a lot of time on this review, and I love buying stuff on Amazon too, so I decided to also put my review here. The exact model I have is the black 15\" Elite model, but I'm sure this review applies to just about any of their 15\" elite models.<br /><br />My unit arrived slightly defective. The hold feature doesn't work. So far, I've had a repair guy out three times, and he still has a part on order to try to fix it. Fortunately, the compactor works in normal mode, so this hasn't prevented me from using it. (One other switch broke within the first week, but the repair man was able to fix this on his second visit. So it was only out of commission for about a week.)<br /><br />The good news is that Broan has been very nice and helpful, and has paid for all of the service visits. So, you can have confidence in their 1-year warranty, and if you get unlucky like me at least you don't have to pay for repairs. With any luck, yours will simply work right out of the box!<br /><br />Because of these warranty issues I've had to deal with, I can't give this a 5-star review. If it arrived in perfect working order, I would have been happy to give it 5-stars.<br /><br />But I can still confidently give it 4-stars. I love this compactor. I'll list the positives, and then address some of the negatives I've read about it in other reviews:<br /><br />Positives:<br /><br />Excellent horse power. This unit crushes glass bottles with ease. In fact, it is so powerful that I decided to stop crushing my glass to a pulp. Now, I use the first glass bottle \"popping\" as the sign that my trash is full, and I take it out to the can. By doing so, this has been a great indication of when it has compacted enough for my tastes. (I haven't even come close to overworking this thing).<br /><br />It looks stylish. I love the black color, and it matches the rest of my appliances. As a free standing unit, it looks great and gets the job done.<br /><br />Excellent capacity. We can fit three days worth of garbage in this thing, including gallon milk jugs, formula containers, etc. (I have two very small kids. We were going through a full kitchen sized bag every day.) I was having trouble fitting all of the trash small kids can generate in a week (diapers, formula containers, milk containers, etc. etc.) in the single curbside receptacle. Now it is very easy. Two of these bags per week is about our new average. That is amazing. I think we are getting about a 4:1 compression ratio, which I think is great.<br /><br />Addressing some unfounded criticism:<br /><br />This unit, freestanding, does indeed tip forward. BUT, once you install the inexpensive front kick plate ($15), this problem goes away. The user manual makes it painfully clear that for a freestanding installation you MUST use this kick plate. This trash compactor has been rock solid ever since I installed that kick plate. I can't get it to tip forward very easily even when I push down on it. Yes, it was very annoying to have to order a second part that I feel should have come with the unit, but I'm not going to knock off any stars over it. Now that I've added this item, I'm over any annoyance I had from needing to place a second order. (I did actually order this kick plate from Amazon, as it turns out.)<br /><br />Trash bags are expensive. Yes, they are. BUT, the generic compactor bags that are sold at Wal-Mart work just fine, if you stretch them just a bit. Oh sure, the company warns you against doing so, but seriously, it is a plastic bag. For about a quarter of the cost, I'm happy to make do with an off-brand bag. Their official bags are great, and easy to use. I just wish they were more affordable. However, the workaround is so easy, I can't really consider this a legitimate downside. I've even considered using Glad Forceflex bags, which I'm sure would work.<br /><br />Not enough compacting power? One review said that stepping on trash would work just as well. This isn't true at all. I certainly can't crush wine bottles just by stepping on them, but this trash compactor laughs at glass bottles. I have to empty the trash as soon as I hear glass breaking, or the compactor would turn them back into the sand from which they came. PLENTY of horsepower. It was very difficult for me to fit all of our garbage into one trash can every week, but now it is easy. (And before I had this unit, I was OF COURSE standing on the trash can smashing it down with my body weight. No way I could do as good of a job, not to mention how silly I looked.)<br /><br />Legitimate complaints: It really isn't as convenient to throw stuff away as with a normal kitchen trash can. You have to open the door, pull out the drawer, and make sure your kids aren't going to tackle you when you are bent over. (Happened to me once, I scraped my arm.) Also, there is no way I want my kids throwing stuff away in here until they get older.<br /><br />However, my wife and I worked around this minor inconvenience very easily by buying a small trash can (bathroom sized) and placing it nearby. Our daughter knows that this is \"her\" trash can, and as it fills up we can throw the little bag inside the compactor. This solution actually worked so well that even we tend to use the little can out of convenience. Then you get the best of both worlds, and you can contain organic items in a smaller bag to be compacted later. Works great, and now that we are doing so I don't even consider the compactor to be a hassle. The usefulness more than overcomes any potential inconvenience caused by needing to open a door and slide out a bin.<br /><br />Oh, and if I haven't mentioned it yet: this thing is FUN. Maybe it is because I'm a guy, but smashing things is kind of satisfying. You feel like your kitchen is that much cleaner. And my little daughter loves watching it go. She runs into the kitchen every time I hit the button to watch the light change from red to green (and she laughs if something pops).<br /><br />I recommend buying one if you need to smash trash. Like I said, I would easily have given it 5-stars if I wasn't dealing with warranty issues.",

The washer doesn't properly wash the clothes.<br />Now that is past the 30 day return policy I cannot return the waster and I'm stuck with it.<br /><br />My recommendation to everyone here is if there is a problem,<br /><br /> ---&#62;&#62;&#62;  DON'T CALL FACTORY SERVICE! &#60;&#60;&#60;---<br />(seriously the dumbest thing I did)<br /><br />Instead quickly return it within the 30 day window to save yourself time and money!<br /><br />TRUST ME! I'm stuck with a washer that hardly works and will have to throw away money to get a properly working one.<br />I even tried contacting customer service and corporate with no luck.<br /><br />Now if you are in the same situation I am in here is what I have found out and recommend.<br /><br />----- problem history and details -------<br /><br />It all started when I first noticed random stains on my clothes after washing them. I watched the wash cycle closely by pausing and watching it.<br />Clothes aren't moving from bottom to top and back down again. Any clothes on the top would never get submerged to get washed. It's supposed to be an high efficiency washer<br /><br />(see image. the sample sock and my undies never went under water and just floated)<br /><br />(I recommend anyone try the same test themselves. Put a white sock on top and pause the wash every couple of minutes to see if it moves.)<br />Now the &#34;tech line&#34; said that this was normal opperation. I watched quite a few videos online and how high efficency washers work and them in action.<br />All the videos I saw did rotate closes from the bottom up.<br /><br />Now the workaround.<br />Always use the deep water (half load) or heavy load (3/4 load) wash. This will make sure there is enough water to cover the clothes.<br />What I do and recommend to give you clean clothes is pause the wash cycle every 5 minutes or so and pull the clothes on the bottom to the top and unpause the cycle.<br /><br />I hope this helps any of those who bought this washer having the same issue I am.",

           "This is the part you need if you are trying to fix your foot pedal operation of trash compactor/n/nWe have an older model Kitchenaid trash compactor. Model number KUCS03FTSS0. This is an under counter installed compactor.<br />It is probably 7-9 years old. It was the type where to compact you lift the foot pedal upwards.<br /><br />One day we noticed that a small metal tab, approx 1.5-2 inch in length, broke off near the foot pedal. The compacting no longer started when we lifted the foot pedal up. I searched and searched online but could not find the little metal tab piece replacement. I came to realize that Whirlpool/Kitchenaid actually completely redesigned this part due to it breaking so frequently. So this part, W10342596, is actually the correct part you need even though it doesnt look like it at all.<br /><br />The installation is a little involved, but I do not consider myself especially handy and I was able to do it by myself, in about 45 minutes taking my time. You do need to completely remove the unit from its installation location and partially disassemble it. It sounds daunting but it's really not. Here are some tips that should help:<br /><br />1) Buy yourself a 1/4 inch nut driver if you don't already have one. This will be extremely useful in disassembling the unit. You'll need regular phillips screwdrivers too but for most of the parts you need this nut driver. I bought this set: [[ASIN:B000BQJ5ZE Dynamite 5 pc Standard Nut Driver Assortment]]<br /><br />2) The trash compactor actually has wheels on the back end, so its actually way easier to uninstall from its under countertop location than i thought.<br /><br />3) Go to youtube and search &#34;W10342596 install&#34; . There is an instructional video on how to install this part. It is very thorough and goes through almost every step. Highly, highly recommended. I didnt even use the included paper instructions once i found this video.<br /><br />Hope this helps!",

I say that because the burner I had originally planned to buy for my stove, to exactly replace my old one, had six turns. It doesn't seem to make a difference in the amount of heat this one puts out. I plugged it in and turned my knob to high and within seconds it was very hot. I normally order everything on Prime in order to receive products faster but this was the cheapest (and most legitimate looking) burner available on Amazon. It arrived in three days (ordered Sunday night arrived Wednesday morning). I think that's pretty good timing for a product only promised to be there within a week and a half. And at half the price of the big box stores I researched this is a good product, even if it was misrepresented as having more turns. Oh and I should mention it is not a genuine Calrod burner, but it works just fine in my late 90's GE range.<br /><br />Update 7-25-2012: Company representative just contacted me and offered very nicely to give me a refund. I insisted that I really am satisfied with the product and she asked if I would then please remove my \"negative review\". While I don't believe my review is negative, in fact, I think it's pretty fair. My only suggestion is to take a picture of the product they intend to mail out so that future customers will know exactly what they are ordering.",

Since this gas range cooktop is one that sits in the counter-top, no bottom oven portion, I did not have to remove the top assembly to install it.  I just needed to remove the grates and pull out the burners and burner tops.  Using a pair of pliers, carefully pull the old electrode straight out. The electrode is held in by friction by the electrode clip. Disconnect the wire and put the new one on.  Slide the electrode down into the hole carefully.  Using a flat head screwdriver through the burner hole, slide the electrode clip up the electrode to keep it tight against the range top. Replace the burners, burner tops, and the grates.  Test and done.  Works like new. Easy and great replacement.",

           "Glad I Bought It/n/nI'm copying and pasting the review I used at Home Depot, because that is where I bought this compactor. However, I spent a lot of time on this review, and I love buying stuff on Amazon too, so I decided to also put my review here. The exact model I have is the black 15\" Elite model, but I'm sure this review applies to just about any of their 15\" elite models.<br /><br />My unit arrived slightly defective. The hold feature doesn't work. So far, I've had a repair guy out three times, and he still has a part on order to try to fix it. Fortunately, the compactor works in normal mode, so this hasn't prevented me from using it. (One other switch broke within the first week, but the repair man was able to fix this on his second visit. So it was only out of commission for about a week.)<br /><br />The good news is that Broan has been very nice and helpful, and has paid for all of the service visits. So, you can have confidence in their 1-year warranty, and if you get unlucky like me at least you don't have to pay for repairs. With any luck, yours will simply work right out of the box!<br /><br />Because of these warranty issues I've had to deal with, I can't give this a 5-star review. If it arrived in perfect working order, I would have been happy to give it 5-stars.<br /><br />But I can still confidently give it 4-stars. I love this compactor. I'll list the positives, and then address some of the negatives I've read about it in other reviews:<br /><br />Positives:<br /><br />Excellent horse power. This unit crushes glass bottles with ease. In fact, it is so powerful that I decided to stop crushing my glass to a pulp. Now, I use the first glass bottle \"popping\" as the sign that my trash is full, and I take it out to the can. By doing so, this has been a great indication of when it has compacted enough for my tastes. (I haven't even come close to overworking this thing).<br /><br />It looks stylish. I love the black color, and it matches the rest of my appliances. As a free standing unit, it looks great and gets the job done.<br /><br />Excellent capacity. We can fit three days worth of garbage in this thing, including gallon milk jugs, formula containers, etc. (I have two very small kids. We were going through a full kitchen sized bag every day.) I was having trouble fitting all of the trash small kids can generate in a week (diapers, formula containers, milk containers, etc. etc.) in the single curbside receptacle. Now it is very easy. Two of these bags per week is about our new average. That is amazing. I think we are getting about a 4:1 compression ratio, which I think is great.<br /><br />Addressing some unfounded criticism:<br /><br />This unit, freestanding, does indeed tip forward. BUT, once you install the inexpensive front kick plate ($15), this problem goes away. The user manual makes it painfully clear that for a freestanding installation you MUST use this kick plate. This trash compactor has been rock solid ever since I installed that kick plate. I can't get it to tip forward very easily even when I push down on it. Yes, it was very annoying to have to order a second part that I feel should have come with the unit, but I'm not going to knock off any stars over it. Now that I've added this item, I'm over any annoyance I had from needing to place a second order. (I did actually order this kick plate from Amazon, as it turns out.)<br /><br />Trash bags are expensive. Yes, they are. BUT, the generic compactor bags that are sold at Wal-Mart work just fine, if you stretch them just a bit. Oh sure, the company warns you against doing so, but seriously, it is a plastic bag. For about a quarter of the cost, I'm happy to make do with an off-brand bag. Their official bags are great, and easy to use. I just wish they were more affordable. However, the workaround is so easy, I can't really consider this a legitimate downside. I've even considered using Glad Forceflex bags, which I'm sure would work.<br /><br />Not enough compacting power? One review said that stepping on trash would work just as well. This isn't true at all. I certainly can't crush wine bottles just by stepping on them, but this trash compactor laughs at glass bottles. I have to empty the trash as soon as I hear glass breaking, or the compactor would turn them back into the sand from which they came. PLENTY of horsepower. It was very difficult for me to fit all of our garbage into one trash can every week, but now it is easy. (And before I had this unit, I was OF COURSE standing on the trash can smashing it down with my body weight. No way I could do as good of a job, not to mention how silly I looked.)<br /><br />Legitimate complaints: It really isn't as convenient to throw stuff away as with a normal kitchen trash can. You have to open the door, pull out the drawer, and make sure your kids aren't going to tackle you when you are bent over. (Happened to me once, I scraped my arm.) Also, there is no way I want my kids throwing stuff away in here until they get older.<br /><br />However, my wife and I worked around this minor inconvenience very easily by buying a small trash can (bathroom sized) and placing it nearby. Our daughter knows that this is \"her\" trash can, and as it fills up we can throw the little bag inside the compactor. This solution actually worked so well that even we tend to use the little can out of convenience. Then you get the best of both worlds, and you can contain organic items in a smaller bag to be compacted later. Works great, and now that we are doing so I don't even consider the compactor to be a hassle. The usefulness more than overcomes any potential inconvenience caused by needing to open a door and slide out a bin.<br /><br />Oh, and if I haven't mentioned it yet: this thing is FUN. Maybe it is because I'm a guy, but smashing things is kind of satisfying. You feel like your kitchen is that much cleaner. And my little daughter loves watching it go. She runs into the kitchen every time I hit the button to watch the light change from red to green (and she laughs if something pops).<br /><br />I recommend buying one if you need to smash trash. Like I said, I would easily have given it 5-stars if I wasn't dealing with warranty issues.",

You can see this through the vent holes at the bottom of the inside of your freezer. You will see a block of ice forming on the evaporator (radiator like thing). I did not know the thermostat was the problem at first but was the cheapest thing to try first. Once I cut off the old thermostat, I spliced this new one in and used heat shrink tubing to cover the wires.

The problem was while the plastic clips fit, and the metal clips fit and the holes lined up, the screws were too big and would not go in. I used a cordless drill to try to get them to go in, but it only stripped the threads off the screws. I ended up having to take some self tapping sheet metal screws and the cordless drill to get them in. Once I did that, everything was secure.<br /><br />Also, the feet for the dryer didn't want to go in more than a 1/8-1/4 turn. Turns out there is some sort of bump in the screw threads that you have to get past. It was a pain to install this kit overall. Physically stacking them wasn't an issue as the dryer is relatively light and I had help. There is no way I would attempt this without a second person, it'd be asking for injury.<br /><br />I wish they would have included the proper screws or at least a couple of sizes of screws. I would not recommend this for someone with the same model of washing machine as me, and who is not familiar with self-tapping sheet metal screws.",

The washer doesn't properly wash the clothes.<br />Now that is past the 30 day return policy I cannot return the waster and I'm stuck with it.<br /><br />My recommendation to everyone here is if there is a problem,<br /><br /> ---&#62;&#62;&#62;  DON'T CALL FACTORY SERVICE! &#60;&#60;&#60;---<br />(seriously the dumbest thing I did)<br /><br />Instead quickly return it within the 30 day window to save yourself time and money!<br /><br />TRUST ME! I'm stuck with a washer that hardly works and will have to throw away money to get a properly working one.<br />I even tried contacting customer service and corporate with no luck.<br /><br />Now if you are in the same situation I am in here is what I have found out and recommend.<br /><br />----- problem history and details -------<br /><br />It all started when I first noticed random stains on my clothes after washing them. I watched the wash cycle closely by pausing and watching it.<br />Clothes aren't moving from bottom to top and back down again. Any clothes on the top would never get submerged to get washed. It's supposed to be an high efficiency washer<br /><br />(see image. the sample sock and my undies never went under water and just floated)<br /><br />(I recommend anyone try the same test themselves. Put a white sock on top and pause the wash every couple of minutes to see if it moves.)<br />Now the &#34;tech line&#34; said that this was normal opperation. I watched quite a few videos online and how high efficency washers work and them in action.<br />All the videos I saw did rotate closes from the bottom up.<br /><br />Now the workaround.<br />Always use the deep water (half load) or heavy load (3/4 load) wash. This will make sure there is enough water to cover the clothes.<br />What I do and recommend to give you clean clothes is pause the wash cycle every 5 minutes or so and pull the clothes on the bottom to the top and unpause the cycle.<br /><br />I hope this helps any of those who bought this washer having the same issue I am.",

I was able to reset it by unplugging it for a few minutes and letting it reset, but then it would begin acting up again.<br /><br />I ordered this replacement control panel which arrived on a SUNDAY - thank you - and was able to replace the unit in just a few minutes.  Unplug the freezer.  Put some blue painters tape around the panel, then get a couple of metal putty knives around it to snap it out.  As others have said, the plastic clips will break, but it's useless anyway, so I think it is designed this way.  Snap the new panel in, and then give it a couple of good hits with the heel of your hand to make sure it snaps in place.  Then plug the freezer back in.  That's all there is to it.",

I researched products and found that Lambro is a high quality manufacturer that has complete matching extensions & transitions so that all pieces are guaranteed to fit together from beginning to end.<br /><br />The entire set begins with a rectangular space-saver duct with extensions that went up through the ceiling, then transitions to 4” round exhaust duct with one round 90° elbow joint, terminating with a floating cup vent. All pieces matched perfectly & I could have secured them with the foil tape alone, but I added 2 rivets per joint for overkill. Lambro’s fabrication is impressive - no gaps or misshapen pieces like what I found in stores. I matched this with a MagVent magnetic dryer hose attachment (not shown) and it all fits seamlessly together.<br /><br />Note: Lambro doesn’t sell products off it’s website, but they list all compatible parts & model numbers that you can subsequently search for online. I found all but one part on Amazon, and all arrived promptly and in excellent condition. Everything can be assembled easily by hand and secured with foil tape. End result is that it looks much cleaner and works far better than the old flexible vent hose, which I’ll never have to replace again.<br /><br />I would definitely purchase all of these products again.",

The old switch broke a long time ago and I just jumpered the connector to bypass it. But for the money, it makes me feel better to have this back in place. It appears almost identical to the one I removed, with one exception - I think this one has an extra metal shield below the paddle part of the switch itself, perhaps to keep an out of balance tub from striking the plastic switch (which is what I think happened to my old one). So that seems like a good thing. One thing to note - this does not come with screws, and I had no idea where mine were. I have plenty of stainless steel screws, but not any countersunk ones, and that's what you really need for this. I used the smallest head I had and they just clear the lid, but I'd like a little more clearance, so I'll locate some better choices. Just something to keep in mind.",

Still getting the same 16ppm reading (and 250+ unfiltered). Love this unit. Highly recommend. Problem free so far(likely just jinxed myself).<br /><br />***ORIGINAL REVIEW****<br />Awesome! No more floating crud in our water from ice. Tastes like water, instead of metal/chlorine. The meter I got reads 16ppm, down from 264ppm. Coffee is sooo much better.<br /><br />Install was simple.<br /><br /> Quieter than my fathers professionally installed system.<br /><br />Feeds my refrigerator which is about 20ft away from the sink(don't know how much pipe there is, but more than 20ft). The flow is certainly slower than it was non-filtered, from the refrigerator door, but it's not bad at all, and I expected this to happen. I'm actually quite pleased as I expected it to be slower.",

           "This is the part you need if you are trying to fix your foot pedal operation of trash compactor/n/nWe have an older model Kitchenaid trash compactor. Model number KUCS03FTSS0. This is an under counter installed compactor.<br />It is probably 7-9 years old. It was the type where to compact you lift the foot pedal upwards.<br /><br />One day we noticed that a small metal tab, approx 1.5-2 inch in length, broke off near the foot pedal. The compacting no longer started when we lifted the foot pedal up. I searched and searched online but could not find the little metal tab piece replacement. I came to realize that Whirlpool/Kitchenaid actually completely redesigned this part due to it breaking so frequently. So this part, W10342596, is actually the correct part you need even though it doesnt look like it at all.<br /><br />The installation is a little involved, but I do not consider myself especially handy and I was able to do it by myself, in about 45 minutes taking my time. You do need to completely remove the unit from its installation location and partially disassemble it. It sounds daunting but it's really not. Here are some tips that should help:<br /><br />1) Buy yourself a 1/4 inch nut driver if you don't already have one. This will be extremely useful in disassembling the unit. You'll need regular phillips screwdrivers too but for most of the parts you need this nut driver. I bought this set: [[ASIN:B000BQJ5ZE Dynamite 5 pc Standard Nut Driver Assortment]]<br /><br />2) The trash compactor actually has wheels on the back end, so its actually way easier to uninstall from its under countertop location than i thought.<br /><br />3) Go to youtube and search &#34;W10342596 install&#34; . There is an instructional video on how to install this part. It is very thorough and goes through almost every step. Highly, highly recommended. I didnt even use the included paper instructions once i found this video.<br /><br />Hope this helps!",
