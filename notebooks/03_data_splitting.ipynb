    "# Data Splitting\n",
    "\n",
    "### Possible Strategies\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Random Split**:\n",
    "    - **Description**: Randomly splits the dataset into training, validation, and test sets.\n",
    "    - **Use Case**: General-purpose model training and evaluation.\n",
    "    - **Pros**: Simple to implement, ensures that each split is representative of the overall dataset.\n",
    "    - **Cons**: May not capture temporal or user/item-specific trends.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Temporal Split**:\n",
    "    - **Description**: Splits the dataset based on timestamps, using older reviews for training and more recent reviews for validation and testing.\n",
    "    - **Use Case**: Evaluating models on their ability to generalize to future data.\n",
    "    - **Pros**: Mimics real-world scenarios where future data is unknown, captures temporal trends.\n",
    "    - **Cons**: May result in imbalanced splits if the dataset has a seasonal trend or uneven distribution of reviews over time.\n",
    "    - **Splitting Strategy**: Given a chronological user interaction sequence of length N:\n",
    "        - **Training part**: Item interactions with timestamp range (-∞, t_1).\n",
    "        - **Validation part**: Item interactions with timestamp range [t_1, t_2).\n",
    "        - **Testing part**: Item interactions with timestamp range [t_2, +∞).\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **User-Based Split**:\n",
    "    - **Description**: Ensures that reviews from the same user are only present in one of the training, validation, or test sets.\n",
    "    - **Use Case**: Personalization and recommendation systems where user history is critical.\n",
    "    - **Pros**: Prevents data leakage from user behavior patterns.\n",
    "    - **Cons**: May lead to splits that are less representative of the overall data distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Item-Based Split**:\n",
    "    - **Description**: Ensures that reviews for the same product are only present in one of the training, validation, or test sets.\n",
    "    - **Use Case**: Evaluating models on new products that were not seen during training.\n",
    "    - **Pros**: Tests the model's ability to generalize to unseen items.\n",
    "    - **Cons**: Similar to user-based split, it may result in less representative splits.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Stratified Split**:\n",
    "    - **Description**: Ensures that the splits maintain the same distribution of a certain feature, such as rating or product category.\n",
    "    - **Use Case**: Ensuring that the model performs well across different subsets of the data.\n",
    "    - **Pros**: Maintains the distribution of important features, leading to more balanced splits.\n",
    "    - **Cons**: More complex to implement, may still miss temporal or user/item-specific trends.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Cross-Validation Split**:\n",
    "    - **Description**: Uses k-fold cross-validation to create multiple training and validation splits.\n",
    "    - **Use Case**: Robust model evaluation and hyperparameter tuning.\n",
    "    - **Pros**: Provides a more comprehensive evaluation by using multiple data splits.\n",
    "    - **Cons**: Computationally intensive, not suitable for large datasets if computational resources are limited.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **Leave Last Out Split**:\n",
    "    - **Description**: A data-splitting strategy to pick up the latest two item interactions for evaluation. This strategy is widely used in many recommendation papers.\n",
    "    - **Splitting Strategy**: Given a chronological user interaction sequence of length N:\n",
    "        - **Training part**: The first N-2 items.\n",
    "        - **Validation part**: The (N-1)-th item.\n",
    "        - **Testing part**: The N-th item."
